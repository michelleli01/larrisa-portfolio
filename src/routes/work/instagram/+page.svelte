				<h2 class="font-semibold text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem]">The Problem</h2>
				<i>Instagram‚Äôs explore page got boring, so I redesigned it..</i>
			</div>

			<p>
				Like many other Instagram users, I use Instagram as a form of entertainment. Whether I‚Äôm
				procrastinating assignments or chilling with friends, I like to scroll through to find posts
				and stories that interest me. However, I oftentimes find that the content I‚Äôm seeing is
				irrelevant or uninteresting to me.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to understand: <b
					>How might Instagram content, particularly on the explore page, be more engaging for
					users?</b
				>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="flex flex-col items-start gap-[1rem]">
			<div>
				<h2 class="font-semibold text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem]">User Research</h2>
				<i>What are pain points for users?</i>
			</div>

			<p>
				Entering this case study, my original hypothesis was: If Instagram did not focus so much on
				the shopping feature, the app would be more engaging. My goal was to identify the problems
				people have with the organization of Instagram. Instead, I found that users had the biggest
				problem with engaging with the app.
			</p>

			<div>
				<p>Key Insights:</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>Users believe that they are recommended irrelevant and uninteresting content.</li>
					<li>Users prioritize seeing the content of people they care about.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p>üò® <i>‚ÄùI get shown random content I don‚Äôt even relate to.‚Äù</i></p>

				<h2 class="font-semibold text-[1.5rem]">Brainstorming</h2>
				<i>Exploring engagement</i>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Problem spaces to explore:</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>
						Uninteresting Content: How might we create more engaging home pages and explore pages
						for users?
					</li>
					<li>
						Prioritizing personal content: How might we give users more control over what they are
						shown?
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<p class="font-semibold"><i>Solution A: Pinning Accounts</i></p>
			<img src={pinning_acc_wireframes} class="md:max-w-[50%]" alt="pinning accounts wireframes" />
			<p>The user would be able to pin content from a user such as stories, posts, and messages.</p>
			<div>
				‚úÖ Prioritizes content that users actually want to see <br />‚úÖ Allows users to find their
				close friends' content easier and quicker <br />‚ùå Decreases time spent on the app <br />‚ùå
				Users may pin too many accounts which counteracts the strengths
			</div>

			<p class="font-semibold"><i>Solution B: Customizing the Explore Page</i></p>
			<img
				src={custom_explore_wireframes}
				class="md:max-w-[68%]"
				alt="pinning accounts wireframes"
			/>
			<p>
				The user would be able to give input on the content that they are shown on the explore page.
			</p>
			<div>
				‚úÖ More engaging content for users <br />
				‚úÖ Increased interaction with explore page & on the app overall <br />
				‚ùå Decrease posting <br />
				‚ùå Decrease in interactions with other users
			</div>

			<p class="font-semibold"><i>Choosing Solution B</i></p>
			<div>
				<p>
					Although both solutions have the same levels of feasibility and impact, I ultimately
					decided to move forward with the feature that allows users to customize the explore page
					because:
				</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>
						Based on interviews, users had the least interest in the explore page. Adding a feature
						to this page would increase engagement with an aspect of the product they did not
						interact with much and increase time spent on the app.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users giving direct feedback to the algorithm will allow for them to feel like they have
						control over what they are seeing.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="flex flex-col items-start gap-[1rem]">
			<div>
				<h2 class="font-semibold text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem]">Entry Points</h2>
				<i>Iterations</i>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>There were two methods of entry that were considered.</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>A separate page to add the interest tag (A, B, C)</li>
					<li>Add interest tag from post (D, E)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<img src={instagram_iterations} alt="instagram interations" />

			<div>
				<p>
					I decided to explore possibilities of creating the entry point at a separate page rather
					than accessing it from a certain post because:
				</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>
						For the explorations D and E presented, we can see that the user would not be able to
						directly add a specific interest. Rather, the app‚Äôs algorithm would determine the
						specific topics of the post and then add those the the user‚Äôs tags.
					</li>
					<li>
						When asked about the ‚ÄúNot interested‚Äù feedback in the horizontal ellipses icon, many
						users that were interviewed were either unaware of the option or did not think it was an
						effective enough way to give feedback to the algorithm as there was explicit indication
						that they would not be shown these types of posts again.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<div>
				<p><b>Ultimately, I chose C as the final entry point because:</b></p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>
						In A, the engineering efforts would be too high as it would require a completely new
						page focused only on interest tags which confused users when tested.
					</li>
					<li>
						In B, the Add and Follow buttons were too similar which users reported they did not like
						as it was too visually cluttered..
					</li>
					<li>
						In C, the design combines the hashtag and interest tag pages but with the addition of a
						like button which adds the topic to the explore page. There is an obvious visible
						distinction between following a tag and adding the tag to the home page.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="flex flex-col items-start gap-[1rem]">
			<div>
				<h2 class="font-semibold text-[1rem] md:text-[1.5rem]">Feedback for Newly Added Tag</h2>
				<i>Iterations</i>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>There were three feedback methods that were considered.</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>Utilizing the colorization of a new stories indicator (A)</li>
					<li>Adding a heart indicator (B)</li>
					<li>No indicator (C)</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<img src={added_tag} alt="iterations for added tags" />

			<div>
				<p><b>I decided to choose B as the new tag indicator because:</b></p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>
						For users, A was too similar to the new stories indicator and misled them to believe
						there would be a stories like interaction when pressing the tag.
					</li>
					<li>
						The users did not like the lack of indication as they wanted some sort of feedback.
					</li>
					<li>
						In B, the design is familiar to users, because it is the same icon used when liking
						posts and adding an interest tag in this case study. It was easy for users to recognize
						and did not mislead them.
					</li>
				</ol>

			<div>
				<p>If I had more time I would:</p>
				<ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside">
					<li>Conduct more thorough user interviews and user testing</li>
					<li>Explore more entry points/other flows</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

				This was my first case study and my first experience designing a product from start to
				finish. I learned how to design and prototype using Figma. I had a lot of fun exploring the
				possibilities product design has to offer!
